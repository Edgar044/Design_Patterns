# Design_Patterns


Design patterns are typical solutions to common problems in software design. Each pattern is like a blueprint that you can customize to solve a particular design probCancel changeslem in your code.

You canâ€™t just find a pattern and copy it into your program, the way you can with off-the-shelf functions or libraries. The pattern is not a specific piece of code, but a general concept for solving a particular problem. You can follow the pattern details and implement a solution that suits the realities of your own program.

What does the pattern consist of?
Most patterns are described very formally so people can reproduce them in many contexts. Here are the sections that are usually present in a pattern description:

Intent of the pattern briefly describes both the problem and the solution.
Motivation further explains the problem and the solution the pattern makes possible.
Structure of classes shows each part of the pattern and how they are related.
Code example in one of the popular programming languages makes it easier to grasp the idea behind the pattern.
